There are several python magic modules available and the one found as "python-magic" on
Ubuntu is different than the one found under the same name on Red Hat and also different
from what you get with PIP under again the same name.

We like this version as it supports analyzing a file in memory and we import it into our
code as a private module to be sure that we always use the same one.
